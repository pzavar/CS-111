A short description of the files included in this tarball:

lab4b.c
This is the .c file that runs on my beaglebone taking in period, scale, and log options as arguments to report a timestamp in the proper format as required by the spec. It demonstrates the use of the MRAA library to record temperatures and uses functions from time.h to create the timestamp.

Makefile:
It performs the following operations.
   1. default - uses gcc to build the program executable
   2. check - runs a small smoke test the ensure the program is functional
   3. dist - builds the tarball that is to be submitted
   4. clean - deletes the file created
